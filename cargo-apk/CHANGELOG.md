# Unreleased

# 0.9.7 (2022-12-09)

- Reimplement default package selection based on `$PWD` or `--manifest-path` by upgrading to [`cargo-subcommand 0.11.0`](https://github.com/rust-mobile/cargo-subcommand/releases/tag/0.11.0).
- Removed known-arg parsing from `cargo apk --` to not make argument flags/values get lost, see also [#375](https://github.com/rust-windowing/android-ndk-rs/issues/375). ([#377](https://github.com/rust-windowing/android-ndk-rs/pull/377))

# 0.9.6 (2022-11-23)

- Profile signing information can now be specified via the `CARGO_APK_<PROFILE>_KEYSTORE` and `CARGO_APK_<PROFILE>_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` environment variables. The environment variables take precedence over signing information in the cargo manifest. Both environment variables are required except in the case of the `dev` profile, which will fall back to the default password if `CARGO_APK_DEV_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` is not set. ([#358](https://github.com/rust-windowing/android-ndk-rs/pull/358))
- Add `strip` option to `android` metadata, allowing a user to specify how they want debug symbols treated after cargo has finished building, but before the shared object is copied into the APK. ([#356](https://github.com/rust-windowing/android-ndk-rs/pull/356))
- Support [`[workspace.package]` inheritance](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/workspaces.html#the-workspacepackage-table) from a workspace root manifest for the `version` field under `[package]`. ([#360](https://github.com/rust-windowing/android-ndk-rs/pull/360))

(0.9.5, released on 2022-10-14, was yanked due to unintentionally bumping MSRV through the `quick-xml` crate, and breaking `cargo apk --` parsing after switching to `clap`.)

- Update to `cargo-subcommand 0.8.0` with `clap` argument parser. ([#238](https://github.com/rust-windowing/android-ndk-rs/pull/238))
- Automate `adb reverse` port forwarding through `Cargo.toml` metadata ([#348](https://github.com/rust-windowing/android-ndk-rs/pull/348))

# 0.9.4 (2022-09-12)

- Upgrade to latest `ndk-build` to deduplicate libraries before packaging them into the APK. ([#333](https://github.com/rust-windowing/android-ndk-rs/pull/333))
- Support `android:resizeableActivity`. ([#338](https://github.com/rust-windowing/android-ndk-rs/pull/338))
- Add `--device` argument to select `adb` device by serial (see `adb devices` for connected devices and their serial). ([#329](https://github.com/rust-windowing/android-ndk-rs/pull/329))
- Print and follow `adb logcat` output after starting app. ([#332](https://github.com/rust-windowing/android-ndk-rs/pull/332))

# 0.9.3 (2022-07-05)

- Allow configuration of alternate debug keystore location; require keystore location for release builds. ([#299](https://github.com/rust-windowing/android-ndk-rs/pull/299))
- **Breaking:** Rename `Activity::intent_filters` back to `Activity::intent_filter`. ([#305](https://github.com/rust-windowing/android-ndk-rs/pull/305))

# 0.9.2 (2022-06-11)

- Move NDK r23 `-lgcc` workaround to `ndk_build::cargo::cargo_ndk()`, to also apply to our `cargo apk --` invocations. ([#286](https://github.com/rust-windowing/android-ndk-rs/pull/286))
- Disable `aapt` compression for the [(default) `dev` profile](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html). ([#283](https://github.com/rust-windowing/android-ndk-rs/pull/283))
- Append `--target` to blanket `cargo apk --` calls when not provided by the user. ([#287](https://github.com/rust-windowing/android-ndk-rs/pull/287))

# 0.9.1 (2022-05-12)

- Reimplement NDK r23 `-lgcc` workaround using `RUSTFLAGS`, to apply to transitive `cdylib` compilations. (#270)

# 0.9.0 (2022-05-07)

- **Breaking:** Use `min_sdk_version` to select compiler target instead of `target_sdk_version`. ([#197](https://github.com/rust-windowing/android-ndk-rs/pull/197))
  See <https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/sdk-versions#minsdkversion> for more details.
- **Breaking:** Default `target_sdk_version` to `30` or lower (instead of the highest supported SDK version by the detected NDK toolchain)
  for more consistent interaction with Android backwards compatibility handling and its increasingly strict usage rules:
  <https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/target-sdk>
  ([#203](https://github.com/rust-windowing/android-ndk-rs/pull/203))
- Allow manifest `package` property to be provided in `Cargo.toml`. ([#236](https://github.com/rust-windowing/android-ndk-rs/pull/236))
- Add `MAIN` intent filter in `from_subcommand` instead of relying on a custom serialization function in `ndk-build`. ([#241](https://github.com/rust-windowing/android-ndk-rs/pull/241))
- Export the sole `NativeActivity` (through `android:exported="true"`) to allow it to be started by default if targeting Android S or higher. ([#242](https://github.com/rust-windowing/android-ndk-rs/pull/242))
- `cargo-apk` version can now be queried through `cargo apk version`. ([#218](https://github.com/rust-windowing/android-ndk-rs/pull/218))
- Environment variables from `.cargo/config.toml`'s `[env]` section are now propagated to the process environment. ([#249](https://github.com/rust-windowing/android-ndk-rs/pull/249))

# 0.8.2 (2021-11-22)

- Fixed the library name in case of multiple build artifacts in the Android manifest.
- Work around missing `libgcc` on NDK r23 beta 3 and above, by providing linker script that "redirects" to `libunwind`.
  See <https://github.com/rust-windowing/android-ndk-rs/issues/149> and <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/85806> for more details.

# 0.8.1 (2021-08-06)

- Updated to use [ndk-build 0.4.2](../ndk-build/CHANGELOG.md#042-2021-08-06)

# 0.8.0 (2021-07-06)

- Added `runtime_libs` path to android metadata for packaging extra dynamic libraries into the apk.

# 0.7.0 (2021-05-10)

- Added `cargo apk check`. Useful for compile-testing crates that contain C/C++ dependencies or
  target-specific conditional compilation, but do not provide a cdylib target.
- Added `apk_name` field to android metadata for APK file naming (defaults to Rust library name if unspecified).
  The application label is now no longer used for this purpose, and can contain a string resource ID from now on.

# 0.6.0 (2021-04-20)

- **Breaking:** uses `ndk-build`'s new (de)serialized `Manifest` struct to properly serialize a toml's `[package.metadata.android]` to an `AndroidManifest.xml`. The `[package.metadata.android]` now closely resembles the structure of [an android manifest file](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-element). See [README](README.md) for an example of the new `[package.metadata.android]` structure and all manifest attributes that are currently supported.

# 0.5.6 (2020-11-25)
