# cargo apk

Tool for creating Android packages.

## Installation

From crates.io:
```console
$ cargo install cargo-apk
```

From source:

```

## Commands

- `build`: Compiles the current package
- `run`: Run a binary or example of the local package
- `gdb`: Start a gdb session attached to an adb device with symbols loaded

## Manifest

`cargo` supports the `metadata` table for configurations for external tools like `cargo apk`.
Following configuration options are supported by `cargo apk` under `[package.metadata.android]`:

```toml
[package.metadata.android]
# Specifies the package property of the manifest.
package = "com.foo.bar"

# Specifies the array of targets to build for.
build_targets = [ "armv7-linux-androideabi", "aarch64-linux-android", "i686-linux-android", "x86_64-linux-android" ]

# Path to your application's resources folder.
# If not specified, resources will not be included in the APK.
resources = "path/to/resources_folder"

# Path to the folder containing your application's assets.
# If not specified, assets will not be included in the APK.
assets = "path/to/assets_folder"

# Name for final APK file.
# Defaults to package name.
apk_name = "myapp"

# Folder containing extra shared libraries intended to be dynamically loaded at runtime.
# Files matching `libs_folder/${android_abi}/*.so` are added to the apk
# according to the specified build_targets.
runtime_libs = "path/to/libs_folder"

# Defaults to `$HOME/.android/debug.keystore` for the `dev` profile. Will ONLY generate a new
# debug.keystore if this file does NOT exist.
# A keystore path is always required on the `release` profile.

If a manifest attribute is not supported by `cargo apk` feel free to create a PR that adds the missing attribute.
