# Unreleased

# 0.4.3 (2021-11-22)

- Provide NDK `build_tag` version from `source.properties` in the NDK root.

# 0.4.2 (2021-08-06)

- Pass UNIX path separators to `aapt` on non-UNIX systems, ensuring the resulting separator is compatible with the target device instead of the host platform.

# 0.4.1 (2021-08-02)

- Only the highest platform supported by the NDK is now selected as default platform.

# 0.4.0 (2021-07-06)

- Added `add_runtime_libs` function for including extra dynamic libraries in the APK.

# 0.3.0 (2021-05-10)

- New `ApkConfig` field `apk_name` is now used for APK file naming, instead of the application label.
- Renamed `cargo_apk` utility to `cargo_ndk`.

# 0.2.0 (2021-04-20)

- **Breaking:** refactored `Manifest` into a proper (de)serialization struct. `Manifest` now closely matches [`an android manifest file`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-element).
- **Breaking:** removed `Config` in favor of using the new `Manifest` struct directly. Instead of using `Config::from_config` to create a `Manifest`, now you instantiate `Manifest` directly using, almost all, the same values.
