//! Bindings for [`ALooper`]
//!
//! In Android, [`ALooper`]s are inherently thread-local.  Due to this, there are two different
//! [`ALooper`] interfaces exposed in this module:
//!
//! * [`ThreadLooper`], which has methods for the operations performable with a looper in one's own
//!   thread; and
//! * [`ForeignLooper`], which has methods for the operations performable with any thread's looper.
